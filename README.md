# 🕹  The palindrome game 🎉
## 🤔 What is a palindrome?

A palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the same from right to left and from left to right.

## 🎯 What is the objective?

Building an app from scratch that allows the user to enter words or phrases to detect if they are palindromes.

## 📏 Which are the rules?

The user will have one minute to enter words.

The user will only be able to enter one word or phrase at a time.

A word or phrase already entered that is a valid palindrome cannot be modified.

## 🧮 How is the score calculated?

If the palindrome entered is a word, it adds one point.

If the palindrome entered is a phrase, it adds two points.

## 💬 What is considered a phrase?

A phrase is considered when the text entered by the user has two or more words.

## 🧩 How should the UI behave?

The screen should start with a button labeled “Let’s play!”.

By clicking on the button “Let’s play!” it should show:

- An input that will allow the user to enter a text
- A button that allows to submit the text entered
- The remaining time the user has to play
- The user's current score

When correctly entering a palindrome:

- The user's score should be updated
- A new input should be displayed that will allow the user to enter another word

When incorrectly entering a palindrome:

- It should display the input borders in red

When time's up:

- It should clear the screen
- It should display the users score
